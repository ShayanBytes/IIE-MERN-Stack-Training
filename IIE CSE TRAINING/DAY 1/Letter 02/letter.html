        <p>
            I am requesting you to kindly grant me leave for 10 days from 1st January to 10th January due to my illness. I have been suffering from a severe cold and fever, and my doctor has advised me to take complete rest during this period.
            I assure you that I will catch up on all the missed assignments and classwork once I    return to school. I have already informed my teachers about my situation, and they have been very understanding.
            I kindly request you to grant me leave for the specified period. I will ensure that I   return to school as soon as I recover.
            Thank you for your consideration and understanding.
        </p>

            I am looking forward to your positive response.
