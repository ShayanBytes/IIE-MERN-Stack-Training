    <h1>Ideal Institute Of Engineering</h1>

    <p>The Ideal Science and Research Welfare Hub is a registered trust established with a steadfast commitment to education, research, and social welfare. Rooted in a vision of philanthropy and academic excellence, the organization was founded through meticulous planning and the collective efforts of dedicated individuals determined to make a difference.

The foundation of this noble initiative was laid by Shri Partha Sarathi Hesh and Dr. Raghupati Goswami, two visionary leaders whose unwavering determination and deep sense of purpose propelled the dream forward. Recognizing the transformative power of education, they aspired to create an institution that would serve as a beacon of knowledge and progress.

Their mission was further strengthened by the invaluable support of Mr. Bratish Kumar Sarkar, an accomplished entrepreneur whose distinguished career has been defined by a legacy of integrity, innovation, and social responsibility. Inspired by the cause, he extended his collaboration.</p>
